## 🔒 Data Privacy & Security Compliance

### 1. Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 (DPDP)

**User Consent:**

function maskAadhaar(aadhaar) {
  return 'XXXX-XXXX-' + aadhaar.slice(-4);
}

// Audit logging
function logDataAccess(userId, officerId, action) {
  await db.auditLogs.create({
    user_id: userId,
    accessed_by: officerId,
    action: action, // 'view', 'download', 'modify'
    timestamp: new Date(),
    ip_address: req.ip
  });

---

## 💳 Payment Compliance

### RBI Guidelines for Payment Aggregators

**Applicable Regulations:**
- Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007

**Mandatory Requirements:**

**1. PCI-DSS Compliance:**
- ✅ Never store card CVV
- ✅ Never store full card number (tokenize)
- ✅ Use payment gateway for all transactions (don't handle card data directly)

**2. Transaction Security:**
```javascript
// Payment flow
function initiatePayment(applicationId, amount) {
  // Generate unique transaction ID
  const txnId = generateTxnId();
  
  // Redirect to payment gateway (not store card details)
  return {
    payment_url: paymentGateway.getURL({
      txnId,
      amount,
      return_url: `${APP_URL}/payment/callback`,
      webhook_url: `${APP_URL}/api/payment/webhook`
    })
  };
}

// Verify callback signature (prevent tampering)
function verifyPaymentCallback(data, signature) {
  const expectedSignature = hmac(data, GATEWAY_SECRET_KEY);
  return signature === expectedSignature;
}
```

**3. Refund Policy (as per 2025 Rules):**
```
Refunds applicable in these cases:
- Application rejected by authorities: 100% refund
- Duplicate payment: 100% refund
- System error: 100% refund

Processing time: 7 working days
Method: Original payment mode
```

**System Implementation:**
```javascript
// Refund processing
async function processRefund(paymentId, reason) {
  const payment = await db.payments.findById(paymentId);
  
  if (!isRefundEligible(payment, reason)) {
    throw new Error('Payment not eligible for refund');
  }
  
  const refund = await paymentGateway.initiateRefund({
    transaction_id: payment.gateway_transaction_id,
    amount: payment.amount,
    reason: reason
  });
  
  await db.payments.update(paymentId, {
    refund_status: 'initiated',
    refund_id: refund.id,
    refund_date: new Date()
  });
  
  // Notify user
  await sendNotification(payment.user_id, {
    type: 'refund_initiated',
    message: `Refund of ₹${payment.amount} initiated. Will reflect in 7 working days.`
  });
}
```

## 📊 Compliance Validation System

### Multi-Level Validation

**Level 1: Frontend Validation (Real-time)**
```javascript
// Example: Category validation
const categoryRules = {
  diamond: {
    minRooms: 5,
    minRoomSize: 120,
    requiredAmenities: ['ac', 'wifi', 'parking'],
    requiredDocs: ['fire_noc', 'pollution_clearance', 'building_plan']
  },
  gold: {
    minRooms: 3,
    maxRooms: 4,
    minRoomSize: 100,
    requiredDocs: ['fire_noc', 'building_plan']
  },
  silver: {
    minRooms: 1,
    maxRooms: 2,
    minRoomSize: 80,
    requiredDocs: ['fire_noc']
  }
};

function validateCategoryCompliance(formData, selectedCategory) {
  const rules = categoryRules[selectedCategory];
  const errors = [];
  
  if (formData.total_rooms < rules.minRooms) {
    errors.push(`${selectedCategory} requires minimum ${rules.minRooms} rooms`);
  }
  
  if (rules.maxRooms && formData.total_rooms > rules.maxRooms) {
    errors.push(`${selectedCategory} allows maximum ${rules.maxRooms} rooms`);
  }
  
  // Check amenities
  if (rules.requiredAmenities) {
    const missingAmenities = rules.requiredAmenities.filter(
      amenity => !formData.amenities[amenity]
    );
    if (missingAmenities.length > 0) {
      errors.push(`Missing required amenities: ${missingAmenities.join(', ')}`);
    }
  }
  
  return errors;
}
```

**Level 2: Backend Validation (On submission)**
```javascript
// Server-side validation (can't be bypassed)
async function validateApplication(applicationData) {
  const validations = [
    validateCategoryCompliance(applicationData),
    validateDocumentCompleteness(applicationData),
    validateFeeCalculation(applicationData),
    await validateAadhaarUniqueness(applicationData.owner_aadhaar),
    await validateDocumentAuthenticity(applicationData.documents)
  ];
  
  const errors = validations.flat().filter(Boolean);
  
  if (errors.length > 0) {
    throw new ValidationError(errors);
  }
  
  return { valid: true };
}
```

**Level 3: AI-Assisted Validation**
```javascript
// AI checks documents
async function aiValidateDocuments(documents) {
  const flags = [];
  
  for (const doc of documents) {
    const aiResult = await aiService.verifyDocument(doc);
    
    if (aiResult.confidence < 0.7) {
      flags.push({
        document: doc.type,
        issue: 'Low quality or unclear document',
        confidence: aiResult.confidence
      });
    }
    
    if (aiResult.detected_type !== doc.claimed_type) {
      flags.push({
        document: doc.type,
        issue: `Claimed ${doc.claimed_type} but detected as ${aiResult.detected_type}`,
        confidence: aiResult.confidence
      });
    }
  }
  
  return flags;
}
```

**Level 4: Officer Review**
- District Officer manually reviews
- AI flags are visible
- Can request clarifications
- Final human judgment
